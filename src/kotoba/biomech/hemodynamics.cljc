  "Blood-flow / airflow CFD via kotoba-lang/kami-engine-cfd (Phase 2 backend).

  Bridges into the D2Q9 Lattice-Boltzmann solver: a 2-D channel with
  no-slip top/bottom walls, a left inlet velocity, and a zero-gradient
  right outlet (these BCs are applied by kami-cfd/lbm-new). An obstacle
  in the channel — a vessel cross-section, an atheromatous plaque, an
  airway constriction — yields a drag the flow exerts on it, a proxy for
  wall shear / flow resistance. Reynolds number is based on obstacle
  height."

(defn channel-with-obstacle
  "Build a 2-D channel `nx` by `ny` lattice cells with a rectangular
  obstacle of width `ow` [cells] and height `oh` [cells] at x-offset
  `ox` [cells]. Returns a kami-cfd Body."

  obstacle height). Inlet / outlet / wall boundary conditions are applied
  by the solver."

(defn obstacle-drag-cd
  "Averaged sectional drag coefficient the flow exerts on the obstacle in
  `body`, at Reynolds `re`, over `steps` LBM steps. A higher Cd means more
  flow resistance (narrower / blunter obstacle)."
