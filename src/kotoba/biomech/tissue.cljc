  WHAT IT IS. A confined-compression equilibrium law is not sigma = H_A * eps.
  It is sigma = sigma_swelling + H_A * eps, because a proteoglycan-rich tissue
  sitting in fluid at zero applied strain is ALREADY carrying a stress: its
  osmotic swelling pressure, held by the confining wall. A caller who omits
  this term attributes the whole applied stress to matrix deformation and
  overstates the strain by sigma_swelling / H_A.

  ONE FIELD, TWO AUTHORS' NAMES, AND THAT IS A JUDGEMENT MADE HERE. Iatridis
  1998 calls it the `reference stress offset, sigma(offset)` (0.13 +/- 0.06 MPa
  normal anulus); Johannessen & Elliott 2005 call it the `swelling stress`
  (Psw = 0.138 +/- 0.029 MPa nondegenerate nucleus). They are the same term of
  the same constitutive law, measured the same way -- confined compression from
  a free-swollen reference -- and Iatridis himself reads his own offset as
  swelling pressure, verbatim: `The significant effects of degeneration
  reported in this study suggested a shift in load carriage from fluid
  pressurization and swelling pressure to deformation of the solid matrix`.
  Carrying two field names would force every reader to try both; carrying one

  because the biphasic momentum balance with Darcy drag is a diffusion equation

  they used `Linear biphasic theory`, so the nucleus carries none. A tissue that
  carries one (the anulus, beta = 2.13 +/- 1.48, Iatridis 1998) is a tissue
  whose literature says a linear reading degrades with strain AND by how much.

  cites Holzapfel's layer ORDERING, and neither supplies a scalar. Those carry
  :supplies-number? false. The key is absent on ordinary sources, so absence
  means true — a source has to opt OUT of counting, which is the safe default

  "How the entry's SCALAR stiffness relates to the sources actually read, or
  nil if the entry has never been through provenance work.

  TWO DIFFERENT THINGS ARE BOTH CALLED `cited`, AND CONFLATING THEM IS THE
  FAILURE THIS KEY EXISTS TO PREVENT. An entry can carry a real citation whose
  numbers bound its scalar without any source having reported that scalar. The
  ligament is the original case: Neumann 1992 reports an ALL modulus of
  759 +/- 336 MPa, the entry carries 5.0e8 Pa, and 5.0e8 is INSIDE 423-1095 MPa
  but is nobody's measurement. Reading `has a citation` as `this number was
  measured` is wrong for that entry and right for the tendon, whose 1.2e9 is
  verbatim Maganaris & Paul's own figure.

  Values:
    :sourced                — the scalar is a number a read source reports, or a
                              stated identity applied to one (e.g. E = 2G(1+nu)
                              with G measured and the identity written out in
                              the entry).
    :unsourced-but-bounded  — no source read reports this value. Sources read
                              bound it, and the entry states where it sits
                              relative to them. This is NOT `verified`.

(defn isotropically-admissible?
  "True if this tissue's Poisson's ratio can be used by an ISOTROPIC linear-elastic
  solver.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Isotropic elasticity requires -1 < nu < 1/2. The bound is a
  consequence of isotropy, not a law about materials: an ANISOTROPIC tissue may
  legitimately measure nu > 1/2, and the human anulus fibrosus does — Elliott &
  Setton 2001 report nu12 = 1.8 +/- 1.4 and nu21 = 1.6 +/- 0.7 at inner sites.

  Feeding such a value to an isotropic solver does not raise anything. It
  computes a bulk modulus K = E / (3(1 - 2nu)), and at nu = 0.67 the denominator
  is negative, so K is NEGATIVE: a material that expands when you squeeze it.
  The solve returns numbers and they are meaningless. kotoba.biomech.fem passes
  :poissons-ratio straight into fea's isotropic linear-elastic material, which
  is exactly this path.

  FAIL-CLOSED ON ABSENCE. A tissue with no Poisson's ratio returns false: this
  predicate cannot certify a value it does not have. Callers that want the
  historical `nil -> 0.3` default must apply it themselves and remain
  responsible for it."
