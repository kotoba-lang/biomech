  ;; THE DISCRIMINATING MEASUREMENT. Three readings of the SAME in-vivo pressure,
  ;; each removing one candidate explanation, against Botsford 1994's measured
  ;; diurnal volume loss of 16.2% (mean, lower three lumbar) and 18.7-21.6%
  ;; per level:
  ;;
  ;;   sigma / H_A                       0.455  -- refuted, and by a lot
  ;;   (sigma - Psw) / H_A               0.319  -- still above 0.216, so the

  ;;   ((sigma/index) - Psw) / H_A       0.131-0.167 -- inside it, or under
  ;;
  ;; Only the third lands, and the third is the one that stops treating a
  ;; nucleus pressure as a stress. That is the evidence for explanation (3) over
